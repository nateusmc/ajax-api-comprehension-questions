# These are the comprehension questions from 10-4 due on 10-9 along with the Gist API app requested on question 3.
#
# 1. What advantages does AJAX provide compared to refreshing when you want new information?

# AJAX is asynchronous, meaming it will load and run while content is being refreshed rather than having to wait for the document to be loaded and ready.

# 2. What is the role of an API in a modern web app?

# The role of an API is to give access to data stored on an external database from another website and use their data in your app, without ever having to access their database.

# 3. Write code which makes an AJAX request to log out the most recent Gist posted to GitHub (hint: you can use #this endpoint: https://api.github.com/gists/public).
